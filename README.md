webscrapped data from charity watch
A project where I webscrapped data from CharityWatch.
I used decision trees in order to simulate human decision making, since these labels should be made based on objective human decisions.
scrapeCharity.py contains the code used to scrape the data.
data.csv contains the scrapped data.
MLcharity.ipynb and studyCharity.R are very similar files that were used to walk through the decisions made for each model.
The main difference between both files is that the R file uses CHAID at the very end.
